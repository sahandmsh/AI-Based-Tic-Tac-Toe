# RL-Based-Tic-Tac-Toe

This project comes in two phases:
1) Training an AI tic-tac-toe player
2) Playing against the AI

For the first phase, Q-learning method is used to allow computer to properly learn and play tic-tac-toe. The RL againt interacts and learns while playing against
random moves. To make sure that RL observes as much states as possible, we may need to set a high number of games that RL plays against random player 
(e.g., 2 000 000).

After training phase is over, now a human player can start playing against the RL agent. It is noted that, the RL will continue to learn while playing against a human player.
Below you can see a sample of the simulation results:
